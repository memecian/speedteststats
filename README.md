# speedteststats
## a python script to automate data collection from Ookla's Speedtest CLI
Does what it says on the tin: runs ookla-speedtest, grabs data collected by it and puts into a tab-delimited text file. From there, you are free to do whatever you want - create a graph, create a scene in your ISP's local shop - the options are endless.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- a working internet connection
